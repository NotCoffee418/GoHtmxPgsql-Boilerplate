static:
- embedded in the application at compiletime
- accessible from /yourfile directly at root of the website
  (useful for favicon, robots.txt, .css, .js, and other common files that do not change at runtime).
- you cannot add static files without recompiling.

dynamic:
- not embedded at compiletime
- accessible at /media
- will reflect in runtime without recompiling
- you should map this to a real directory when using Docker rather than placing files here
  if you intend to use this for anything other than the postcss build included in this boilerplate.


WARNING: global.css is in dynamic because it is compiled by the server at runtime.
You can change this to use static if preferred (it would improve load time), but you need to
set `config.DoMinifyCss` to false and set up your own precompile build process for css.


This file is safe to remove if desired.
